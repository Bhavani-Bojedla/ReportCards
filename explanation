Explanation of the Approach:

1.Data Loading and Validation:
     The script reads the Excel file using pandas.
It ensures all required columns (Student ID, Name, Subject, Score) are present.

2.Data Aggregation:
    It calculates the total and average scores per student using groupby.

3.PDF Generation:
   For each student, a personalized PDF is created with:
     Their name, total score, and average score.
      A table of their subject-wise scores.
   The PDFs are named as report_card_<StudentID>.pdf and saved in a report_cards directory.

4.Error Handling:
   The script checks for missing columns and handles unexpected errors gracefully.

5.Reusable Functions:
   A separate function, generate_pdf, is used for creating the PDF, ensuring modularity.
